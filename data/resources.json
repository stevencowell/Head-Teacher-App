        "description": "All chemicals need to be kept in a locked chemical cupboard and each item must be registered in “Chem Watch”, outlining the product name, amount, and where it is stored. A copy of the latest TAS chemicals files can be found here.  Also material safety data sheets are to be obtainable for each item. These are printed and stored in the TAS staff room above the headteacher VET’s desk. The department’s Chemical safety in schools  website can be found. A link to Chemwatch Gold can be found here. The Departments Chemical Safety Requirements can be found\nSafety Data sheets must be readily accessible in the room where the substances are used/stored. Access can be electronic. In the past SafeWork have recommended that the mini Safety Data sheets (one page) is kept in the room where they are stored, rather than the full version.  This is so that in the event of a power fail, easy access the summary SDS for emergency responses i.e. first aid, spills etc. Staff can then access the full one online if needed. Below is the link to Chemical safety requirements within the department, including CSIS. There is also a webinar that specifically deals with high school settings.\nhttps://education.nsw.gov.au/inside-the-department/health-and-safety/risk-management/chemicals-and-sharps   Cheryl McKee Work Health and Safety Advisor | Health and Safety Directorate 27.7.2021\nSafe Work Australia Preparation of safety data sheets for hazardous chemicals Code of Practice JUNE 2023\nDepartment of Ed - Health and Safety Directorates:-   FACT SHEETS\nChemicals:-\nHow to Approach Chemical Safety\nRequired Chemical Systems and Registers\nEveryday Chemicals & Cleaners\nGeneral Assistants and Farm Assistants\nGeneral Guidelines on How to Approach Chemical Safety - TAS\nChemical support material:-\nChemical Safety in Schools\nChemical Safety - GHS\nChecklist for working with hazardous substances - V1\nSharp objects support materials:-\nSharp objects - overview and key steps -V1\nGuidance in completing the risk management plan proforma - sharp objects - V2\nSample risk management plan: sharp objects - V1\nSafeWork - Hazardous chemicals\nChemical Safety in Schools (CSIS) Webinar slides\nNesa information\nSection 1: General information for all staff  here\n1.7 Risk Assessment - a pre-requisite for risk control\n1.8 Control measures for schools\n1.9 Hazardous Chemical Register and Manifest\n1.10 Managing chemicals in the school environment\n1.11 Protection equipment - Preventing chemical injury\n1.12 The Principal's guide to implementation\nSection 2: ChemWatch Technology Support  here\nChemWatch Training , Inventory files for the chemical register in Appendices B and Globally Harmonized System of Classification and labelling of Chemicals\nSection 3: Curriculum support Documents 3.3 (TAS)\nOrganising Chemicals  labelling, signs, storage\nSafe practice for technology learning environment  Lesson planning, preparation and maintenance of learning environment, Classroom management strategies, Contingency planning, Emergency evacuation procedures,\nUsing chemicals – containers, Preparation of chemicals, heating chemicals, fumes, spills and cleaning up\nSafe practices in food preparation areas, Using electric power tools\nInformation about common dangerous or hazardous activities General advise for chemicals commonly used in TAS ~\nadhesives,\ncleaning chemicals\nFabric dyes and printing inks\nfixatives\nmetals\n3.3.1 potential long-term health effects from some metal or their compounds\npaints\npetroleum products\nCommon dangerous or hazardous activities\nDisposal of unwanted materials",

Student numbers are kept on the school register via the front office nominated SAS staff member and updated to BOS by the Deputy (Curriculum).  A process is also set up for students who already have a USI from other RTO’s to be registered. For students who leave school before we can obtain their USI, a letter and the USI package is sent to their home address with clear instructions on how to complete the necessary USI components.\nUSI instructions from QMS\nUSI can still be verified through QMS here. A special template must be uploaded for the verification process.\nOnce verified update - VET Markbook, Evidence Central",

A copy is on google drive here with instructions on creating a google link.\nIt is used by the trainer to record relevant industry activities, industry or vocational training or professional learning. Trainers are required to maintain and securely store this document by uploading it to the QMS “Currency” folder. Trainers are required to keep a record of their log that outlines two years of industry and vocational currency.\nNote that the “Evidence” column on the log asks trainers to store evidence of each entry on the log in the Currency folder.
